      The Wolf of Wall Street is a 2013 American biographical black comedy crime
      film directed by Martin Scorsese and written by Terence Winter, based on
      the 2007 memoir of the same name by Jordan Belfort. It recounts Belfort's
      perspective on his career as a stockbroker in New York City and how his
      firm, Stratton Oakmont, engaged in rampant corruption and fraud on Wall
      Street, which ultimately led to his downfall. Leonardo DiCaprio, who was
      also a producer of the film, stars as Belfort, with Jonah Hill as his
      business partner and friend, Donnie Azoff, Margot Robbie as his wife,
      Naomi Lapaglia, and Kyle Chandler as FBI agent, Patrick Denham, who tries
      to bring Belfort down.
