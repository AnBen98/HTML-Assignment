      Harry Potter is an orphaned boy brought up by his unkind Muggle
      (non-magical) aunt and uncle. At the age of eleven, half-giant Rubeus
      Hagrid informs him that he is actually a wizard and that his parents were
      murdered by an evil wizard named Lord Voldemort. Voldemort also attempted
      to kill one-year-old Harry on the same night, but his killing curse
      mysteriously rebounded and reduced him to a weak and helpless form. Harry
      became extremely famous in the Wizarding World as a result. Harry begins
      his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and learns
      about magic. During the year, Harry and his friends Ron Weasley and
      Hermione Granger become entangled in the mystery of the Philosopher's
      Stone which is being kept within the school. Harry Potter and the Chamber
      of Secrets (2002) Main article: Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets

      monster. Harry must face up to claims that he is the heir of Salazar
      Slytherin (founder of the Chamber), learn that he can speak Parseltongue,
      and also discover the properties of a mysterious diary, only to find
      himself trapped within the Chamber itself. The Glenfinnan Viaduct in
      Scotland (which the Hogwarts Express passes en route to Hogwarts),
      features in four films in the series, including the Dementor scene in

      'champions' representing each school in the deadly tasks. The Goblet of
      Fire chooses Fleur Delacour, Viktor Krum, and Cedric Diggory to compete
      against each other. However, Harry's name is also produced from the Goblet
      thus making him a fourth champion, which leads to a terrifying encounter
      with a reborn Lord Voldemort. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix

      Lord Voldemort's return. Harry is also beset by disturbing and realistic
      nightmares, while Professor Umbridge, a representative of Minister for
      Magic Cornelius Fudge, is the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher.
      Harry becomes aware that Voldemort is after a prophecy which reveals:
      "neither can live while the other survives". The rebellion involving the
      students of Hogwarts, secret organisation Order of the Phoenix, the
      Ministry of Magic, and the Death Eaters begins. Harry Potter and the
