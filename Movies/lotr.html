    <p>
      The Lord of the Rings is a series of three epic fantasy adventure films
      directed by Peter Jackson, based on the novel written by J. R. R. Tolkien.
      The films are subtitled The Fellowship of the Ring (2001), The Two Towers
      (2002), and The Return of the King (2003). Produced and distributed by New
      Line Cinema with the co-production of WingNut Films, the series is an
      international venture between New Zealand and the United States. The films
      feature an ensemble cast including Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Liv Tyler,
      Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin, Cate Blanchett, John Rhys-Davies, Christopher
      Lee, Billy Boyd, Dominic Monaghan, Orlando Bloom, Hugo Weaving, Andy
      Serkis and Sean Bean. Set in the fictional world of Middle-earth, the
      films follow the hobbit Frodo Baggins as he and the Fellowship embark on a
      quest to destroy the One Ring, to ensure the destruction of its maker, the
      Dark Lord Sauron. The Fellowship eventually splits up and Frodo continues
      the quest with his loyal companion Sam and the treacherous Gollum.
      Meanwhile, Aragorn, heir in exile to the throne of Gondor, along with
      Legolas, Gimli, Boromir, Merry, Pippin and the wizard Gandalf, unite to
      save the Free Peoples of Middle-earth from the forces of Sauron and rally
      them in the War of the Ring to aid Frodo by distracting Sauron's
      attention.
